   :: project description

 
    - jReform is a small library for processing HTML forms that
      aims to simplify web development by automating validation
      of form inputs.

    - Inputs are evaluated according to predefined criteria.

    - Validation is performed behind the scenes, allowing developer
      to concentrate on application logic.

    - Additional manual validation can be be added if necessary.

    - Once validated, input values are converted into specified
      Java types.
